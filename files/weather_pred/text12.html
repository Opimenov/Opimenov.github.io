<h1><b>
</b>Undersampling &amp; Oversampling<b>
</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>Our dataset was right on the borderline between what was recommended as being “large” and “small,” (~10,000 samples) but we had better results with oversampling and combinations of oversampling and undersampling than with any of the undersampling algorithms alone.</li>
<li>We only resampled the training data with its target after doing the suggested split by years. Our trained classifiers then made predictions on the unmodified set of test features. This was based off of the recommendation of the cited source, Brownlee.</li>
